#summary Dump of ideas for new features
#labels Featured,Phase-Requirements

These are just some ideas of features Tim and I came up with to add to LogScrobbler.

These are quasi-ordered based on priority - eventually, we will probably add these as "Issues" in the tracker.

== The List ==

  * simplify UI
  * display more meaningful error messages
  * update the Audioscrobbler submission code
  * disable Time Shift button if not able to shift
  * display as local timezone/timezone selection
  * add command line options
  * encrypt password
  * systray ico change on detect log.
